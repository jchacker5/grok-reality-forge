- Goal (incl. success criteria): Build full visionOS app "Grok Reality Forge" with working prompt-to-immersive flow, using xAI image API, minimal manual setup beyond Vision Pro on Wi-Fi and API key.
- Constraints/Assumptions: Use xAI API endpoint; avoid extra user questions unless blocked; implement as real app (not just scaffold).
- Key decisions: Use SwiftUI + RealityKit; store API key in Keychain (debug override via UserDefaults); local persistence via JSON in Documents; explicit save required; xAI image API uses width/height (not size); default model grok-2-image-1212, omit quality unless imagine model; SHARP support via configurable endpoint with USDZ response and panorama fallback.
- State:
  - Done: Created continuity ledger; initialized Xcode project; added SwiftUI/RealityKit sources, models, services, views, assets; created Vision Pro simulator device and launched app; patched speech toggle crash guard; added .env and .gitignore (excluding .env); added starter presets + seeding logic + prompt jump-in UI; generated placeholder Grok-style app icon; updated image API params to width/height; added effective API key fallback to UserDefaults override for seeding/generation in debug; built and installed app to Vision Pro simulator; verified starter worlds generated (5 images + worlds.json) in container after seeding; added README.md with contribution note; updated starter presets to 5 and seeding to add missing prompts; side panel now uses image cards and opens immersive space on tap; added SHARP settings + service + renderer hook with USDZ endpoint support and fallback; rebuilt and relaunched app after changes.
  - Now: Verify immersive rendering and card selection behavior on simulator; confirm SHARP mode by providing endpoint.
  - Next: Commit to new public repo and push; draft hackathon tweet.
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed): Official Grok icon asset; Git remote details for pushing README and code; SHARP endpoint details (required for full SHARP mode).
- Working set (files/ids/commands): CONTINUITY.md, README.md, GrokRealityForge/Models/AppModel.swift, GrokRealityForge/Models/StarterWorlds.swift, GrokRealityForge/Views/WorldLibraryView.swift, GrokRealityForge/Views/WorldCardView.swift, GrokRealityForge/Views/WorldDetailView.swift, GrokRealityForge/Reality/ImmersiveWorldView.swift, GrokRealityForge/Services/SharpService.swift, GrokRealityForge/Services/AppSettings.swift
